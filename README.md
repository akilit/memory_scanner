# memory_scanner
currently a work in progress...

This script was inspired by the popular Cheat Engine program, which is a memory scanning and modifier software. I frequently used this program when I was younger to hack games, notably Plants v Zombies. The downside is that the program is exclusive to the Windows OS so I wanted to create a similar memory scanner script through Apple's Developer Documentation to scan for integer values in a running process and modify integer values.
